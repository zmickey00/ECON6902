            Thank you for being part of our study. This experiment is designed to examine how investors interpret and act upon price information when making financial decisions. You do not need to have any background in finance or prior experience with investing — just follow the instructions carefully and rely on your common sense to respond as best you can. On this page, there are some crucial instructions about the game. Reading and understanding them may increase your final compensation. We appreciate your time and effort in contributing to this research!

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <strong>Financial Market</strong><br>
            In this experiment, you will play 4 individual games. The games are mostly identical except that they represent different fluctuations of the financial market.
         To make things simple, these games use the <u>stock price</u> to represent the market's fluctuation. For example, if you have $2 worth of investment and the <u>stock price</u> moves from $1 (this <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>) to $1.3 (next <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>), then you will have $2 × <sup>$1.3</sup>&frasl;<sub>$1</sub> = $2.6 worth of investment in the next <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>.
            Your job is to make the most money in each game.
        </div>


        <div class="instruction-section">
            <strong>Individual Games</strong><br>
            Each game consists of 20 <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u>. In each game, you will start with $10 initial endowment. The <u>stock price</u> will be revealed to you in some of the <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u>. <u style="color: #dc3545;"> In the rounds</u> that  you can see the <u>stock price</u>, you can choose how much you want to invest into the financial market, so that the amount you invested will grow or shrink with the financial market <b>until</b> the <u style="color: #004080;">round</u> you can see the <u>stock price</u> again. In those <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u> where you do NOT see the <u>stock price</u>, you CANNOT make any investment decision. Moreover, in those <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u> that you can see the <u>stock price</u> and make investment decisions, we will automatically withdraw all of your previous investment and add them to your available balance.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <strong>Your Compensation</strong><br>
            At the end of each game, you will see your final balance. At the end of this experiment, one game will be randomly selected and the amount you earned in this game will be used for your compensation. To ensure fairness despite randomness, we will also add $5 to your final payment.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction-section">
            <strong>Next Page</strong><br>
            The next page will explain how the <u>stock price</u> will change between <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u>. Some of the information provided above will be presented to you again. You are <b>2</b> pages from game 1.
