            <strong>Stock Price</strong><br>
            This experiment mimics a stock whose <u style="color: green;">value</u> is more likely to rise if it has risen in the last round, and the value is more likely to fall if it has fallen in the last round. It also mimics the <u style="color: red;">noise</u>  in the financial market caused by random or irrational behaviors. <br>
             More precisely, the <u>stock price</u> is equal to the sum of the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock and the random <u style="color: red;">noise</u>. Your investment will only rise or shrink with the <u>stock price</u>. This experiment tries to mimic the real investment decision-making process so <b>only</b> the <u>stock price</u> will be disclosed to you.<br>

             <br>In all games, <b>from the first round to the second round</b>, the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock has the same chance to rise or fall by $0.05.
             <b>From the second round on</b>, if the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock has increased from last round to this round, then it has a 90% chance to rise by $0.05 and a 10% chance to shrink by $0.05 from this round to next round. Conversely, if the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock has decreased from last round to this round, then it has a 90% chance to shrink by $0.05 and a 10% chance to rise by $0.05 from this round to next round. <br>
             <br>The <u style="color: red;">noises</u> are some random dollar amounts. They are independent of each other between rounds and games. In each round, they are randomly drawn from -$0.06 to $0.06 (any number between them can be drawn). Values closer to $0 are more likely to be drawn than those further away. For instance, the <u style="color: red;">noise</u> is more likely to be -$0.015 than $0.056.<br>
             <br>The <u>stock price</u> is equal to the sum of the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock and the <u style="color: red;">noise</u> in each round. Hence, be aware that the <u style="color: red;">noise</u> can have a larger magnitude than the change of value. For example, it may be the case that the <u>stock price</u> increased from the last round while the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock decreased from the last round. <br>
             <br>The games will <b>only</b> disclose the <u>stock price</u> to you, which can be similar to bottom right graph. As displayed below, the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock in these graphs has been increasing in all rounds (the bottom left graph - you will not see while playing), but there are some rounds (2 to 3, 5 to 6, 7 to 8) that the <u>stock price</u> went down. These graphs are representing the movement of the <u>stock price</u> in a game. When you are playing the game, you will NOT see the future <u>stock price</u>.
        <img src="{% static 'graph11.png' %}" alt="Graph" width="700"> <br>
             <b>Notice</b> that the <u style="color: green;">value</u> of the stock in this example has been increasing in all rounds - this can be the case but NOT necessarily. We will generate the <u>stock price</u> in all the games strictly following the rules above. Again, your investment will only rise or fall with the <u>stock price</u>.

            <strong>Financial Market</strong><br>
            In this experiment, you will play 4 individual games. The games are mostly identical except that they represent different fluctuations of the financial market.
         To make things simple, these games use the <u>stock price</u> to represent the market's fluctuation. For example, if you have $2 worth of investment and the <u>stock price</u> moves from $1 (this <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>) to $1.3 (next <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>), then you will have $2 Ã— <sup>$1.3</sup>&frasl;<sub>$1</sub> = $2.6 worth of investment in the next <u style="color: #004080;">round</u>.
            Your job is to make the most money in each game.
        </div>


        <div class="instruction-section">
            <strong>Individual Games</strong><br>
            Each game consists of 20 <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u>. In each game, you will start with $10 initial endowment. The <u>stock price</u> will be revealed to you in some of the <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u>. <u style="color: #dc3545;"> In the rounds</u> that  you can see the <u>stock price</u>, you can choose how much you want to invest into the financial market, so that the amount you invested will grow or shrink with the financial market <b>until</b> the <u style="color: #004080;">round</u> you can see the <u>stock price</u> again. In those <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u> where you do NOT see the <u>stock price</u>, you CANNOT make any investment decision. Moreover, in those <u style="color: #004080;">rounds</u> that you can see the <u>stock price</u> and make investment decisions, we will pre-withdraw all of your previous investment and add them to your available balance.
