            <p>Welcome to the Stock Market Investment Game. Here's how it works:</p>
            
            <h4>Game Rules:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You will play 4 rounds</li>
                <li>In each round, you start with ${{ Constants.initial_balance }} cash balance</li>
                <li>Each round has 20 ticks, representing time periods</li>
                <li>At each tick, you can invest money in the stock market or withdraw from your investment</li>
                <li>The money you invest will fluctuate with the stock price</li>
                <li>Your money not invested will remain stable in your cash balance</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>How to Play:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter a positive number to move money from your balance to investment</li>
                <li>Enter a negative number to withdraw money from your investment</li>
                <li>You have 60 seconds to make each decision</li>
                <li>If you don't make a decision in time, no change will be made</li>
                <li>Your final payoff for each round is the sum of your cash balance and investment value</li>
            </ul>
